Airplane is an app for buying airline tickets that allows you to explore any place you want!

Airplane is the final result of the online class "Mastering Flutter 2.0: Build Travel App" that held by BuildWith Angga. In this class I learned a lot about the basics of Flutter, the right way of slicing UI from Figma to code, and using firebase as storage and authentication. It doesn't end there, after completing the class I try to implement some of the things I learned from the class, I try to add dynamic data myself and then add it to the application, I also changed some layouts.
